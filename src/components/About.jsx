      <p className="text-white">I Started Programming in spring 2022.
        The first course that I took was the CS50x from Harvard. Then I continued with variety of courses from Freecodecamp.
        Then I started creating my own projects and learning from the original documentations
        from variety of libraries like React, Tailwind.css, Three.js etc.
